# Amount of folowers of each religion based on the follower income

This project need the student to find and clean real datasets with data with religious theme of 2 cities of Brazil, using Pandas,
then, plot a nice and insightful visualisation using matplotlib

The chart created provides useful information about the number of followers of various religions versus these people with the lowest income and the highest income.

I got data of the relation between religions and their followers incomes, of my born city Vit√≥ria and a near city called Vila Velha.
I wanted to find out what was the religion with the most followers that were in a wealth situation, and similar for people that have the minimum wage as income, with a nice chart for a quick insight.
